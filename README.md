## Hi there 👋

- I'm a second-year master's student at Graduate School of Engineering Science Osaka University.
- I'm currently researching about deep generative models such as Diffusion Models.
- I am also participating in an internship at a healthcare company, where I am involved in building a machine learning system using capillary images and developing APIs.
